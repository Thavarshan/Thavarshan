![I am a Software Engineer](https://github.com/Thavarshan/Thavarshan/blob/master/images/thavarshan-banner.png)

I LOVE writing code. Ever since writing my first program in PHP and manipulating it to produce a desired output, I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.

Skills: C++ / PHP / Python / JavaScript
